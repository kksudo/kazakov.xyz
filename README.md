# Description

A public personal website of [kazakov.xyz](https://kazakov.xyz) based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework and [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme.

This site is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## What I should todo, if I would like exactly the same personal page 

1. Fork me and update files below:
    1. [./config.toml](config.toml) - Just add links to yours social networks, or remove unused. For the main pic I used `gravatar`, but you can use this setting `avatarurl = "images/avatar.jpg"`. To read more about Hugo config.toml, please read [here]().
    2. [about.md](content/about.md) - Add few words about your self.
2. Follow to step [4 Cloudflare Pages](https://hackernoon.com/deploy-your-personal-web-page-with-hugo-cloudflare-and-github-100percent-for-free) from the guide.
