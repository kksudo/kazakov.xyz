[Kirill Kazakov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kazakovk/) is an engineer, mentor, and a bit of a dreamer who sees K8s, AWS, and CI/CD not just as tech buzzwords but as a playground of freedom and possibilities. He’s spent 15 years in IT, including 5 as a DevOps “wizard,” building systems that amaze and inspire.

Hi!     
I’m Kirill, and my world revolves around Kubernetes, the cloud, and technologies that run like Swiss watches. I’m a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) and AWS Certified Solutions Architect—which sounds cool, but really just means one thing: I know how to tame complex infrastructures and transform them into works of art. I teach the “Kubernetes-Based Infrastructure Platform” course at [Otus](https://otus.ru/lessons/infrastrukturnaya-platforma-na-osnove-kubernetes/), create educational programs for [SkillFactory school](https://skillfactory.ru/devops-engineer), and write articles for [Medium](https://kksudo.medium.com/), [Dzone](https://dzone.com/users/4670608/kk-sudo.html), [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/kksudo), and [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/users/kksudo/). My writing isn’t just about commands and configs; it’s about how technology can change the world.

I’m an active member of the **“I Want to Know Everything”** and **“Happy to Share What I’ve Learned”** communities, where I exchange experiences and fuel my own inspiration. I’m always around and ready to help-catch me at k@kazakov.xyz. 

Right now, I’m working for an international company, serving as CTO at a startup, and simultaneously launching my own project, which I believe will be a game-changer in IT. 

### My mission goes beyond coding

**I’m here to build bridges to a future where technology opens doors for everyone**.

**Let’s build it together!**
